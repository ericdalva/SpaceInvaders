This a Win32 app that is sort of like space invaders. I wrote it because I wanted to write a bit of code in C and get a feel for how the windows API's work. if you'd like to play you use the arrow keys to control your ship. if you like to compile the code yourself I used MSYS2 UCRT64 and ran the command 
```bash
gcc main.c -o gametest.exe -lgdi32
```
this project was particularly helpful as an introduction to making a Win32 game https://github.com/DanZaidan/break_arcade_games_out
